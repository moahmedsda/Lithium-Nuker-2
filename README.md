# Lithium Nuker 2 is dead.
It has come to my attention that multiple people are attempting to impersonate myself and the other developer of Lithium, Russian Heavy, now vividsec. I'd say I regret taking down Lithium's source from Github, except all I ever got was braindead DMs that asked me basically how to skid it and ask me the dumbest questions, below I will list some of the worst.
<br><br>
I feel that nuking is, and should be completely dead, it has completely lost all its appeal and the community is worse than ever.
<br><br>
If you see another download of Lithium, expect it to be malware. Lithium itself was never malware, despite braindead skids constantly accusing a fully open source project of containing malware and stuff. People who had an IQ lower than my rooms ambient temperature in celcius would just believe anything that their shitty antivirus would tell them. Including false positives.

# Advisories and such
Lithium does not have a vanity anymore and has not for a long time, anyone that has one, is either impersonating, or has good taste for vanity urls. vividsec and I do not have any vanities relating to Lithium.
<br>
**As of 2/20/22, the vanity .gg/lithium is held by some braindead impersonators that believe they're me and vividsec.**

Anyways, Lithium is completely dead, and here is a couple IDs of impersonators, with a link to their current profile:
